**Hola!** 😁

I am a **Research Engineer** at the Research and Development department at Centrica. I develop and implement **demand-side response** solutions using state-of-the-art machine learning models and operations research, heavily focused on data-driven and scalable control techniques for distributed energy assets, e.g., electric vehicles, batteries.

I am also an active core team member at [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://climatechange.ai), currently growing 🌱 a **Power Systems Working Group** to create an open-source research-oriented community. Join our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/7M3MeSKr3g)!

### research interests

My research passion lies at the intersection between power systems modelling and machine learning applications – lately I've been super interested in ***reinforcement learning***, ***graph neural networks***, and ***causality*** applications for the power grid.
